    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm learning web development, and this is one of my very first HTML projects.</p>

    <h3>My Learning Journey</h3>
    <p>I started learning HTML to understand how websites are built. Every tag I learn makes things clearer.</p>

    <p>My goal is to build cool and accessible web pages that look good on any device.</p>

    <p>As I keep learning, I'll add more features, CSS styling, and even some JavaScript to make this page interactive.</p>
